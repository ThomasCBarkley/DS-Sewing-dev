# --- Installation ---
# Edit the following 15 parameters to reflect your web server's configuration


# The "DateFormat" Parameter
# This parameter specifies the format of dates within your log files,
# and how dates should be formatted in the reports that FlashStats
# generates.  For users in the United States, the default of MDY will
# work fine.  The most common non-U.S. format is DMY.
#
# When specified on a line all by itself, this parameter applies to all
# user accounts.  If necessary, an individual user account can be
# overridden with a different value by including a DateFormat= parameter
# in the user account definition line.  This usually isn't necessary
# because FlashStats will try to automatically recognize the date
# format of the log file.
#
# -- Valid values are DMY, DYM, MDY, MYD, YDM, and YMD
# -- Example:     DateFormat=DMY
# -- Default:     DateFormat=MDY
# -- This parameter is optional; if not specified, then the default
# -- format of MDY will be used if a format cannot be determined
# -- from the log file

;DateFormat=MDY




# The "Debug" Parameter
# Set this parameter equal to 1 in order to view some debugging
# information including what log files FlashStats finds (files found,
# date range and format identified), and memory usage
# information. This information can be useful to identify
# misconfigured user accounts. The debug parameter can also be
# specified in a user account so that FlashStats does not return debug
# information for all the user accounts.
#
# -- Example:     Debug=1
# -- Default:     Debug=0
# -- This parameter is optional; if not specified, then debugging will
# -- not be enabled  

;Debug=1




# The "ErrorLog" Parameter
# This parameter specifies the location of the FlashStats error log.
# Any errors generated by FlashStats will be logged to this file.
#
# -- Use forward slashes (/) in the path
# -- Default:     ErrorLog=/usr/local/etc/flashstats/errors.log
# -- This parameter is required

ErrorLog=/usr/local/flashstats/errors.log




# The "ExtraFooter" Parameter
# Use this parameter to specify a string of HTML code that will be
# placed at the bottom of each report generated by FlashStats.
#
# -- Example:     ExtraFooter=<a href="/">Home</a><p>
# -- Default:     (none)
# -- This parameter is optional; if not specified, then no extra
# -- footer will be displayed 
# -- Remove the leading ';' on the following line if you wish to enable it

;ExtraFooter=




# The "ExtraHeader" Parameter
# Use this parameter to specify a string of HTML code that will be
# placed at the top of each report generated by FlashStats.
#
# -- Example:     ExtraHeader=<img src="/images/isplogo.gif"><p>
# -- Default:     (none)
# -- This parameter is optional; if not specified, then no extra
# -- header will be displayed. Remove the leading ';' on the following
# -- line if you wish to enable it 

;ExtraHeader=




# The "FixGmt" Parameter 
# Use this parameter to instruct FlashStats to assume that all times
# were logged as relative to GMT.  When you set FixGmt=1 FlashStats
# will convert all hit times from GMT to local time.  With the default
# FixGmt=0 (or not specified) then times are not converted.  You can
# usually leave this parameter commented out.  But if you are using
# IIS 4 or WebSTAR 3 and you notice that hits seem to be occurring at
# the wrong time you should set FixGmt=1. 
#
# -- Example:     FixGmt=1
# -- Default:     FixGmt=0
# -- This parameter is optional; if not specified, then times will
# -- not be converted. Remove the leading ';' on the following line if
# -- you wish to enable it

;FixGmt=1




# The "FlashStatsPath" Parameter
# This parameter indicates the leading portion of the URL to use for
# your installation of the FlashStats support files (graphics).  This
# value is used to build URLs embedded in the reports that FlashStats
# generates, so it needs to reflect the name of a document directory
# served by your web server.  By default, FlashStats installs the
# necessary files to a directory named /FlashStats under your HTML
# root directory, so this value should be /FlashStats If this
# parameter is not specified, then a default value of /flashstats will
# be used.  If you specify a full path such as
# http://www.yourdomain.com/FlashStats then when reports are saved to
# disk and later re-opened their graphics will display correctly.
#
# -- Do not end the path with a slash
# -- Use forward slashes (/)
# -- Example:     FlashStatsPath=/util/FlashStats
# -- Default:     FlashStatsPath=/FlashStats
# -- This parameter is optional; if not specified, then the default
# -- will be used.  Remove the leading ';' on the following line if
# -- you wish to enable it 

FlashStatsPath=https://www.ds-sewing.com/flashstats/




# The "InternalIP" Parameter
# This parameter specifies host names or IP addresses of *clients* which
# will be able to run any user's report without providing the user
# password.  We recommend that you only list webmasters or other users
# "internal" to your organization.  Note that if the web server does not
# have reverse DNS lookup turned on, then you should only specify IP
# addresses here instead of host names.
#
# -- Use any combination of host names or IP addresses
# -- Separate entries with a comma
# -- Example:     InternalIP=maximized.com,204.182.161.
# -- Default:     (none)
# -- This parameter is optional; if not specified, then the user
# -- password will be required. Remove the leading ';' on the
# -- following line if you wish to enable it 

;InternalIP=yourdomain.com




# The "LogFormat" Parameter
# Use this parameter if your log files have a non-standard format and
# are not self-identifying.  Most logs are not this way and therefore do
# not need the LogFormat parameter.  If you have customized your log
# format for a server such as WebSTAR that has self-identifying log
# files, then you also don't need to use the LogFormat parameter.
# However, if you have a non-self-identifying and non-standard log file
# format then you do need to use the LogFormat parameter.
#
# The following log formats are automatically recognized by FlashStats
# on all platforms and do not need a "LogFormat=" specification:
#  Common Log Format, Extended (or Combined) Log Format, Windows Log
#  Format (O'Reilly WebSite), WebSTAR Log Format (Macintosh), MacHTTP Log
#  Format (Macintosh), Microsoft IIS or PWS Log Format (Windows), IIS /
#  PWS FlashLog Format (Maximized Software), WebTrends Plug-in Log Format
#  (WebTrends Software)
#
# When specified on a line all by itself, this parameter applies to all
# user accounts.  If necessary, an individual user account can be
# overridden with a different value by including a LogFormat= parameter
# in the user account definition line.  This usually isn't necessary.
#
# -- See chapter 5 of the online documentation at
# -- http://www.maximized.com/products/flashstats/docs/ 
# -- for an explanation of the format of this parameter.
# -- Example:     LogFormat=Shmw1qrcfa
# --  This example sets the log format to Extended/Combined log format
# -- Default:     (none)
# -- This parameter is optional; if not specified, then FlashStats
# -- will try to auto-detect the log file format. Remove the leading
# -- ';' on the following line if you wish to enable it 

;LogFormat=




# The "Networks" Parameter
# This parameter specifies the location of the file which contains
# network descriptions (used in the Types of Domains report).
#
# -- Use forward slashes (/) in the path
# -- Default:     Networks=/usr/local/etc/flashstats/networks.txt
# -- This parameter is required

Networks=/usr/local/flashstats/networks.txt




# The "Priority" Parameter
# Use this parameter to specify an alternate priority of execution for
# the FlashStats CGI program.  For UNIX systems, this value is
# equivalent to the "nice" function. Valid values are from 0 to 19
# inclusive.  0 is normal priority, 19 is lowest priority (slowest,
# best-yielding). Priority 0 is the default.  For Windows and
# Macintosh systems, this value can range from -2 to 2, inclusive. The
# default is 0, which makes FlashStats run at default priority.  -2
# runs slowest (and yields more); 2 runs fastest (but yields less).
# For Macintosh systems, the default is 0 and you can set it higher if
# you wish, but you probably shouldn't go higher than 10.  The higher
# the number the less responsive your server will be to other
# requests.
#
# -- Example:     Priority=10
# -- Default:     (none)
# -- This parameter is optional; if not specified, then FlashStats
# -- will run at default priority.
# -- Remove the leading ';' on the following line if you wish to enable it

;Priority=0





# The "RemoteDebugEnabled" Parameter
# Set this parameter equal to 1 in order to allow Maximized Software
# technical support to perform remote debugging of your FlashStats
# installation.  Set it back to 0 in order to disable remote debugging.
#
# -- Example:     RemoteDebugEnabled=1
# -- Default:     RemoteDebugEnabled=0
# -- This parameter is optional; if not specified, then remote
# -- debugging will not be enabled 

RemoteDebugEnabled=0




# The "SmartMemoryEnabled" Parameter
# Use this parameter to instruct FlashStats to handle memory usage
# intelligently.  With the default SmartMemoryEnabled=1 (or not
# specified) FlashStats will attempt to free blocks of memory used if
# the memory runs out while processing large log files.  This is done
# in a way that the top results for each report are still very
# accurate. But there will be loss in depth, or number of uniqe
# entries. (The alternative is that if FlashStats runs out of computer
# memory while executing, it will stop with no report returned.)
#
# -- Example:     SmartMemoryEnabled=0
# -- Default:     SmartMemoryEnabled=1
# -- This parameter is optional; if not specified, the default is to
# -- enable smart memory allocation. Remove the leading ';' on the
# -- following line if you wish to disable this feature.

;SmartMemoryEnabled=0




# The "SmartParsing" Parameter
# If you have a lot of user accounts defined in this file, you can
# enabled the SmartParsing parameter to slightly speed up the parsing of
# this configuration file.  With SmartParsing turned off (which is the
# default), FlashStats will read the entire file, in case any of the
# "global" parameters (such as Networks, ErrorLog, or InternalIp) are
# located below the user account definitions.  But if you can guarantee
# that all global parameters are located above the user account
# definitions, and then enable SmartParsing, then FlashStats will stop
# parsing this file after it finds the user account definition.  This
# extra efficiency is only noticeable if you have hundreds or thousands
# of user accounts.  Most users will not need to use this parameter, and
# should leave it commented out.
#
# -- Example:     SmartParsing=1
# -- Default:     (none)
# -- This parameter is optional; if not specified, then normal parsing
# -- will be used for this file.  Remove the leading ';' on the
# -- following line if you wish to enable it 

;SmartParsing=1




# The "UserPasswords" Parameter 
# You can use this parameter to specify a different location from
# which FlashStats should retrieve user account passwords.  For UNIX
# systems, specify the full path to an file generated by the Apache
# utility htpasswd or any file with a format like
# /etc/password. Passwords in the file can be either plaintext or
# encoded with crypt. For Windows NT or Macintosh systems, specify the
# special value UserPasswords=system which will attempt to verify a
# FlashStats user account to a user account as defined in the
# operating system.  If a FlashStats user account does not specify a
# password then the above method will be checked to find a password to
# validate the account. Most users will not need to use this
# parameter, and should leave it commented out.  If you use this
# parameter, then you might also want to use the SmartParsing
# parameter.
#
# -- See chapter 5 of the online documentation at
# -- http://www.maximized.com/products/flashstats/docs/ 
# -- Example 1:   UserPasswords=system                (NT or Mac systems)
# -- Example 2:   UserPasswords=/usr/www/.htpasswd    (Apache on UNIX) 
# -- Default:     (none)
# -- This parameter is optional; if not specified, then passwords will
# -- be taken from the user account definition. Remove the leading ';'
# -- on the following line if you wish to enable it 

;UserPasswords=




# --- User Account definitions ---
#
# User account definitions consists of several  key=value  pairs, separated
# by semicolons.  All of the pairs must be on one long line.  Always start
# the line with the  user=USERNAME  pair.
#
# The "user=USERNAME" Parameter
# This pair indicates the name of the user account.
# This parameter is required.
# Example:  user=joe
#
# The "password=PASSWORD" Parameter
# This pair indicates the password that the user must provide when
# running a report for this user account.  This value is not
# case-sensitive.  You can omit the password parameter if you want no
# restrictions on who can use this user account.
# Example:  password=please
#
# The "title=TITLE" Parameter
# The title value will be printed in the summary report at the top of
# the FlashStats output.  If this parameter is omitted, a default title
# of "Web Site Analysis" will be used.
# Example:  title=Summary of Joe's Account
#
# The "url=URL" Parameter
# This pair tells FlashStats the root portion of the user's URLs.
# FlashStats will use this value and append document paths in order to
# get full URLs, which are then embedded in its output.  For example, if
# you specify url=http://www.abc.com and FlashStats finds a request to
# your site for homepage.htm, then FlashStats will put the two together
# to realize that the full URL for the requested document is
# http://www.abc.com/homepage.htm
# This parameter is required.
# Example:  url=http://www.mydomain.com
#
# The "logs=FULL/PATH/AND/PATTERN" Parameter
# This parameter is very important; it tells FlashStats where to find
# the log files for this user account.  You need to specify a full path
# to the log files, including a pattern to match old log files.  For
# example, if you have your web server configured to rotate (or archive)
# its log files every day, since the start of the year you may generated
# log files with names such as 970101.log, 970102.log, 970103.log, and
# so on.  Use the logs parameter to provide a full path and wildcard
# pattern to match these files.
# Example 1:  logs=/usr/www/logs/*.log
# Example 2:  logs=/usr/local/etc/apache/logs/access*
# Example 3:  logs=/var/log/www/97*_log
# This parameter is required.
#
# The "accesslog=FULL/PATH" Parameter
# If the "current" log file being actively written to is not matched by
# the wildcard pattern used in the "logs" parameter as described above,
# then you may use the accesslog parameter in order to tell FlashStats
# where to find the current log file.
# Example:  accesslog=/usr/local/etc/apache/logs/access_log
#
# You can also add other key=value pairs to specify values which would
# normally be submitted to FlashStats via the report request form.  See
# the documentation for details.
#
# USER ACCOUNTS:
# -- Each user account must be on one long line with no carriage returns.
# -- The first pair must be:  user=USERNAME
# -- Format:      user=USERNAME;=password=PASSWORD;title=TITLE;url=URL;logs=FULL/PATH/PATTERN;AccessLog=FULL/PATH/FILENAME
# -- Example:     user=example;password=please;title=Summary Report;url=http://www.mydomain.com;logs=/usr/local/etc/apache/logs/*.log
# -- Default:     (none)
# -- At least one user account definition is required
#

#user=sample;password=;title=Web Site Analysis;url=http://www.mydomain.com;logs= /usr/local/etc/apache/logs/*.log;accesslog=/usr/local/etc/apache/logs/access_log


user=sample;password=;title=Web Site Analysis;url=https://www.ds-sewing.com;logs=/data/sites/ds-sewing.com/logs/access;accesslog=
