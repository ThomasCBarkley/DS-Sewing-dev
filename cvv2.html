An important new security feature for card-not-present transactions now appears on the back of most credit cards. This new feature is a three-digit value which provides a cryptographic check of the information embossed on the card.

The CVV2 three-digit value is printed on the signature panel on the back of credit cards immediately following the credit card account number.
