Instructions</STRONG>   </FONT></CENTER>
<P><FONT>If your swimming pool is a standard size, you can buy a cover almost 
anywhere. Of course, Dave Steinhardt hopes you buy it from him at D.S. Sewing. 
But not every pool looks the same these days � some feature waterfalls, while 
others contain fountains. Shapes and sizes are limited only by a pool owner�s 
imagination. And if you own a custom-designed pool, Steinhardt may be the only 
one who can make you a properly fitting cover. One-of-a-kind pool owners often 
wind up with covers that are too big or small � if they don�t call D.S. Sewing 
first. Steinhardt hears from people like that all the time. One satisfied 
customer had Greek columns inside his pool. The man called five different 
manufacturers, and none of them could make him the right cover. �The guy finally 
found us, and we did it in a week,� Steinhardt says. �When they can�t do a job, 
D.S. Sewing can.� The key is a unique measuring process that enables D.S 
Sewing�s design software to simulate the exact size and shape of your pool. This 
foolproof method relies on the same principles used by land surveyors. It may 
seem a little tricky at first, but most people have no problem with it. And 
customers agree the effort is worthwhile once they receive their perfectly 
fitting pool cover from D.S. Sewing.</FONT></P>

     1. Find the shape that best 
represents your pool: rectangular, oval, round, kidney shaped, or �L�-shaped etc....</CENTER><CENTER>

<P>2. If you do not have a round or kidney-shaped pool, identify each point on 
your pool�s perimeter where two lines intersect. �Points of intersection� 
include the corners of the pool and the corners of your stairwell if it is 
external. For an oval pool, the points of intersection are where the parallel 
lines on either side meet the arcs at each end. If you have a diving board, the 
back corners are considered points of intersection, as well as the places on the 
pool�s perimeter which are directly underneath either side of the board. If your 
pool has a ladder, the places where the railings connect to the sidewalk are 
points of intersection, and so are the areas on the pool perimeter directly 
underneath each railing. (pictures of intersecting points on rectangular, oval, 
and �L�-shaped pools � each with external stairs, a ladder, and a diving 
board)</P>

alt="" src="/images/pool_images/corner.gif" width="155" height="107" 
>            
            
             
               
                
             
             
               
              
         
            
   &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<br> * Note: Most pools have rounded corners, so to find the 
true �points of intersection� you must take a ruler and extrapolate where the 
sides would have met if the corner was a perfect 90 degree angle.</P>
<CENTER>3. Place a small, triangle-shaped piece of masking tape at 
each point of intersection. Draw a dot on the tape at the exact place where the 
lines meet, and number each piece of tape in order as you go around the pool�s 
perimeter. (picture of pool perimeter showing pieces of tape with dots and 
numbers) For oval pools, in addition to placing tape where the parallel lines 
meet the arcs at either end, put pieces of tape in a few places around each arc 
� including the tops of the arcs. (picture showing an arc with pieces of tape 
around it) For a round pool, place eight triangular pieces of tape at evenly 
spaced intervals around the perimeter. (picture showing where tape pieces go 
around round pool) For a kidney-shaped pool, place a triangular piece of tape at 
the top of each arc and at several other places in between. (picture showing 
where to put tape around kidney-shaped pool) Label the location and number of 
each triangle on the pool outline located on D.S. Sewing�s printable 
pool-measuring form. </CENTER>

<CENTER>4. Draw a dot in the middle of two small square-shaped pieces 
of tape. Label one square �1� and the other �2.� Attach the pieces to the ground 
somewhere near your pool, spaced so that the dot on square one is exactly 10 
feet away from the dot on square two.</CENTER>
<CENTER>&nbsp;5. Using a long tape measure, find 
the distance from the dot on square one to the dot on triangle one. Then measure 
the distance from square two to triangle one. Record these measurements in the 
appropriate chart on your printable form. Repeat this process with every piece 
of tape around the pool, measuring the distance from each triangle to squares 
one and two.</CENTER>
<CENTER>&nbsp;6. Measure the distance from the 
dot on triangle one to the dot on triangle two, then from triangle two to 
triangle three, and so on. Record these numbers in the appropriate chart on your 
printable form.</CENTER>
<CENTER>&nbsp;</CENTER>
<CENTER>7. Measure the distance across the pool between triangles, 
wherever possible. Record these numbers on your printable form.(picture showing 
lines connecting triangles across pool)</CENTER>
<CENTER>&nbsp;</CENTER>
<CENTER>8. Return your completed form to D.S. Sewing, along with a 
photo of your pool.<BR>*Note: you must leave the tape pieces around your pool until 
D.S. Sewing receives and approves your measurements.</CENTER>
