          <P>D.S. Sewing Inc. Quality Policy</P>

          <P>D.S. Sewing Inc.'s goal is to consistently provide high quality, reliable products and services that meet
            or exceed the expectations of our customers. We will actively pursue ever improving quality through our

          <P> Freight Damage</P>

          <P>All products are shipped FOB point of origin. Ownership of the product transfers to the CUSTOMER upon pick
            up by the carrier. The CUSTOMER's only recourse for reimbursement of damaged goods is from the freight
            carrier. It is the CUSTOMER's responsibility to inspect all products upon receipt before signing any
            paperwork from the carrier. Packaging must be removed for inspection. All of this is very important. It is
            the CUSTOMER's responsibility to inspect for any hidden damage before the freight carrier leaves your
            facility. If you suspect damage, open immediately for further inspection. Even if the package appears
            slightly damaged, write"Package Damaged" on all copies of the receiving paperwork when you sign for
            delivery. If the product is significantly damaged, you may refuse delivery of the shipment. The freight
            company and D.S. Sewing Inc. and it's vendor should be notified immediately so we can address the damaged
            product and also take care of shipping replacement product as quickly as possible. Once product has been
            received by the customer, any reimbursement for freight damage will be through the carrier's freight claim
            process. Photos should be taken and the product held for inspection by the carrier.
            <P />

          <P>Delivery Refusal
