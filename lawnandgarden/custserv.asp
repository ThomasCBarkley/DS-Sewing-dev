						Credit Cards ONLY<br>
						DS-Sewing currently accepts the following credit cards: Visa, MasterCard, and 
						Check or Money Order. We do not release your credit card information to any outside 
						organizations. The transferring of your credit card information is safely handled 
						by a third party credit card processing company. DS-Sewing does not store credit 
						card information on our servers. Credit Cards are not charged until your order is shipped.

						<a name="1003"><FONT size="2"><B>Is Online Shopping safe?</B></font><br>
						We have all heard a lot of talk about whether shopping on the Internet is safe. The main concern of online shoppers is that their credit card information will somehow end up in the wrong hands.
                        DS-Sewing encrypts your order information, keeping it private and protected. It's a technology called "SSL" (Secure Sockets Layer) and it's used by us and all the other major commercial shopping sites,
                        including: The Wall Street Journal, Barnes & Noble Books, FTD Flowers, Microsoft, and Netscape itself.
                        It is actually safer to transmit your credit card info over the Internet than it is to use your credit card around town. <P>
                        In the event that there is a problem with your purchase, the credit card company will remove the purchase from your bill and the on-line merchant is not paid.
                        In the event that your credit card number is stolen, the credit card companies do not hold you responsible for any unauthorized purchases. 
                        <a href="#Customer">back to top</a>
						
						<P>
						
						<a name="1004"><FONT size="2"><B>Privacy</B></font><br>
						DS-Sewing is committed to protecting your privacy. We do not distribute, sell or rent 
						your name, e-mail address, or personal information to any third party. If we do give 
						information to our marketing partners, it is in the form of grouped statistics. We do not 
						send unsolicited emails. Our system manually sends e-mail order confirmations and shipping notices. 
						
						
						
						We collect your name, address, and credit card information so we can fill your order. 
						Our secure server encrypts this information so that it cannot be read as it travels over 
						the Internet. All credit card information is sent immediately to the credit card 
						processing company over a secure connection.<P>
						
						We do not store any credit card information on our servers.

						<a name="1009"><B>International Shipping</B><br>
											
						<B>Attention International Customers!</B><br>
						DS-Sewing currently only ships to the United States and Canada
						For most international orders, our policies are the same as in the United States. 
						Please read the policies and customer service documents carefully before ordering. 
						Listed are some helpful reminders for customer shipping to international locations:
						
						<OL>
							<LI>Check with local authorities concerning any applicable taxes, duties, and/or 
							customs delays. We are not responsible for any of these fees or delays.</li>
							<LI>Some countries place restrictions on certain imports, and some of these 
							imports are banned altogether. Please check with your local authorities before placing 
							an order. While we can refund the merchandise cost if an item is returned to us 
							due to import restrictions, we cannot refund the shipping and handling charges. 
							In some cases, customs officials will confiscate the restricted items, in which we 
							cannot refund the merchandise or the shipping and handling costs.</li>
							<LI>When ordering internationally, please be patient for the arrival of your order. 
							There are many delays that may occur that are beyond our control caused by such 
							things as weather, language barriers, duties, taxes, import restrictions, and customs 
							services. Please be understanding of this complex but necessary operation of 
							delivering your order.</li>

						Thank you. All orders are subject to our approval. This information is subject 
						to change at any time without notice.

						<a name="1010"><FONT size="2"><B>Promotions</B></font><br>
						<B>What is the Promotion Code/Discount Coupon box?</B></br>
						DS-Sewing occasionally gives an online user a special offer. In order to receive 
						the offer, there is a code given that has to be entered into this optional code box 
						at the time of checkout. If you do not have a code, please disregard the box; your 
						order will process normally. Only one special offer code can be applied per order. 
						To redeem a Discount Coupon enter the code in this box. We recommend that you copy 
						and paste the code to avoid any errors.<br>
						Important: You can only use a Promotion Code/Discount Coupon code once.

						<a name="1011"><FONT size="2"><B>Most Often Asked Questions</B></font><br>
						
						<OL>
							<LI>Can you tell me the status of my order?<br>
							Yes, but you need to call us at 1 800 789 8143. </li>
							
							<LI>Can I fax or mail in my order?<br>
							Yes, include your phone number in the order so that we can contact you and verify your purchase.</li>
							
							<LI>My order is overdue - where is it?<br>
							Our policy is to wait 15 days before declaring a United States order lost. 
							We wait 30 days for shipments outside the United States. If you are not in the 
							United States, you should check with your local postal or customs office, as 
							many times an order is held there. If your order has not arrived within these 
							time frames, send an e-mail to support@ds-sewing.com and be sure to include the 
							order number provided to you in the order confirmation email.</li>
							
							<LI>Why do you need my e-mail address?<br>
							DS-Sewing requires your telephone number to verify your order, especially for custom tarps.
							DS-Sewing will send two emails to you, order confirmation and shipping confirmation.
							We do not sell or share your e-mail address with anyone.</li>
